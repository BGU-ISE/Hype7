Watch the new trailer for #JurassicWorldDominion and get tickets now.--https://uni.pictures/JWSitehttps://uni.pictures/JWFBhttps://uni.pictures/JWTwitterhttps://uni.pictures/JWIGhttps://uni.pictures/JWTikTokThis summer, experience the epic conclusion to the Jurassic era as two generations unite for the first time. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are joined by Oscar®-winner Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill in Jurassic World Dominion, a bold, timely and breathtaking new adventure that spans the globe. From Jurassic World architect and director Colin Trevorrow, Dominion takes place four years after Isla Nublar has been destroyed. Dinosaurs now live—and hunt—alongside humans all over the world. This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with history’s most fearsome creatures. Jurassic World Dominion, from Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment, propels the more than $5 billion franchise into daring, uncharted territory, featuring never-seen dinosaurs, breakneck action and astonishing new visual effects. The film features new cast members DeWanda Wise (She’s Gotta Have It), Emmy nominee Mamoudou Athie (Archive 81), Dichen Lachman (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), Scott Haze (Minari) and Campbell Scott (The Amazing Spider-Man 2). The film’s returning cast includes BD Wong as Dr. Henry Wu, Justice Smith as Franklin Webb, Daniella Pineda as Dr. Zia Rodriguez and Omar Sy as Barry Sembenè.  Jurassic World Dominion is directed by Colin Trevorrow, who steered 2015’s Jurassic World to a record-shattering $1.7 billion global box office. The screenplay is by Emily Carmichael (Battle at Big Rock) & Colin Trevorrow from a story by Derek Connolly (Jurassic World) & Trevorrow, based on characters created by Michael Crichton.

I have been working on posting more but somehow always always always run up against some deadline. I am going to implement a new strategy where I am making a little bit of content every day instead of planning a ton and then making a lot of content all at once. idk what's the solution, but hopefully this workflow will be better for me. I just want to very casually make a video and be like hey i was in ny had pizza was a good time or hey i did this thing here's what happened funny jokes bla bla bla and not have it be once every one or two months. idk im just venting at this point. just know that i really appreciate you checking out the video even though my posts are super spotty, it's really helpful.thank you for watching as always ❤️MERCH IS HERE:https://icecreamsandwich.store/📱 twitter:https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy📷 instagram:https://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/"

Though the company also has a more run-of-the-mill office space, Houseplant mainly operates out of a 1918-built Los Angeles bungalow. ”We did not set out to base Houseplant out of a house,” the comedian says - but it makes perfect sense. “A lot of our products are home goods.

They spent nearly a decade recording collisions in the Tevatron collider and another decade analysing the data. This culminated in the April 7 announcement that this obscure particle’s mass seems to be heavier than expected. So why do we care? Because understanding why this particle even has mass was one of the most important breakthroughs in our understanding of the subatomic world. And because measuring its precise mass either doubles down on our current understanding or reveals a path to an even deeper knowledge. The FermiLab discrepancy is a tantalizing hint of the latter.Need Catch Up On Your Fundamental Forces?https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsPUh22kYmNAnurqRx9JlDGukZCsYcLhFCheck out the Space Time Merch Storehttps://www.pbsspacetime.com/shopSign up for the mailing list to get episode notifications and hear special announcements!https://mailchi.mp/1a6eb8f2717d/spacetimeHosted by Matt O'DowdWritten by Fernando Franco Félix, Graeme Gossel, & Matt O'Dowd Post Production by Leonardo Scholzer, Yago Ballarini, Pedro Osinski, Adriano Leal & Stephanie FariaGFX Visualizations: Fernando Franco FélixDirected by Andrew KornhaberAssociate Producer: Bahar GholipourExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew KornhaberExecutives in Charge (PBS): Adam Dylewski, Maribel Lopez Director of Programming (PBS): Gabrielle Ewing Spacetime is produced by Kornhaber Brown for PBS Digital Studios.This program is produced by Kornhaber Brown, which is solely responsible for its content.© 2022 PBS.

Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1sOriginally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 #travel #travelvlog #vanlife0:00 Moving Into Our New Tiny Home on Wheels2:00 We Found the Most Magical Natural Hot Spring in the Jungle4:31 We Almost Hit an Ant Eater4:59 Don't Do This If You're Afraid of Heights6:35 Arenal Volcano7:18 Thank You BetterHelp for Sponsoring This Video8:18 Costa Rican Food Tour11:05 Nate Fails to Impress the Locals11:44 An Update on Van Life12:33 Sleeping In Someone's Front Yard13:12 Full Tour of Our New Tiny Home On Wheels19:18 CROCODILE BRIDGE20:22 Thank You For 3 Million Subscribers!!!21:48 Beach Front Camping23:40 This Was Not How We Wanted Our Trip To End"

Barkley called Nets' player Kevin Durant a 'bus rider', going on to say  If you ain't driving the bus, don't walk around talking about you a champion. Durant, or course, didn't take that lying down. With plenty of time on his hands now that the Nets' season is over, KD took to social media to post all of the times in his career Barkley had been a 'bus rider' himself. Nick Wright and Chris Broussard share their thoughts on this feud, and decide who has proven to be the real 'bus rider' over the years.#FirstThingsFirst #NBA #KevinDurantDownload the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: https://foxs.pt/3z96p0jSUBSCRIBE to get the latest from First Things First: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRSTThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb►Watch the latest content from First Things First: https://foxs.pt/LatestOnFIRSTTHINGSFIRST▶The Herd with Colin Cowherd’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD►UNDISPUTED’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED ▶Speak for Yourself’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeSPEAKFORYOURSELF►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE►Club Shay Shay’s YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY▶Titus & Tate's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTITUSANDTATE►The Skip Bayless Show YouTube Channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow►What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube Channel: http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtubeSee more from First Things First: http://foxs.pt/FIRSTTHINGSFIRSTFoxSportsLike First Things First on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/FIRSTTHINGSFIRSTFacebookFollow First Things First on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/FIRSTTHINGSFIRSTTwitterFollow First Things First on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/FIRSTTHINGSFIRSTInstagramFollow Nick Wright on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/NickWrightTwitterFollow Chris Broussard on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Chris_BroussardFollow Kevin Wildes on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/KevinWildesTwitterFollow Jenna Wolfe on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/JennaWolfeTwitterAbout First Things First:Nick Wright, Chris Broussard, Kevin Wildes, and Jenna Wolfe team up on First Things First, a discussion and opinion-based studio program that covers all the headlines weekdays on FS1.Kevin Durant fires back at Charles Barkley's 'bus rider' critique | NBA | FIRST THINGS FIRSThttps://youtu.be/5_fcT49dJgEFirst Things Firsthttps://www.youtube.com/c/FirstThingsFirst"

The IBF and WBC welterweight champion showed his greatness against WBA champion Yordenis Ugás, battling back from early adversity to stop Ugás in the tenth round. The remaining welterweight title not in Spence’s possession belongs to WBO titleholder Terence Crawford, who was an interested observer on Saturday, Tweeting his reaction to the Spence victory. Spence made clear his preference for his next opponent.   “Everybody knows who I want next,” Spence said. “I want Terence Crawford. That’s the fight that I want. That’s the fight everybody else wants. Like I said, I’m going to get these straps then go over there and take his too. Terence I’m coming for that belt!” Spence had to overcome some harsh conditions courtesy of Ugás to get to this point. After Ugás hurt Spence in the sixth, knocking his mouthpiece out with an uppercut, Spence of DeSoto, Texas, stormed back to hurt Ugás repeatedly to the body and eye. By the tenth round, Ugás’ right eye was completely shut when referee Laurence Cole stopped the contest for the second time to allow the ringside physician to inspect the damage. Unlike earlier, the doctor advised Cole to stop the bout at 1:44 of the tenth round, giving Spence (28-0, 22 KOs) a resounding victory, a third welterweight belt, and perhaps the greatest triumph of his still accumulating career following a 17-month layoff after corrective surgery to his left eye forced him to pull out of a mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao.   “I feel sad,” Ugás said. “I trained really hard for this fight. All my respect to Errol Spence. He’s a great champion. I’m just sad about what happened tonight. The referee stopped the fight, but I wanted to keep going to the end. I definitely had a chance to win the fight in the sixth round, but he recuperated well. Congratulations to him and his team.”#ErrolSpenceJr #YordenisUgas #SpenceUgasVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.SIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: https://pbcham.ps/FightAlertsFOLLOW US:https://twitter.com/premierboxinghttps://instagram.com/premierboxinghttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions"

Now that sounds like skyrim is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits excluding unlimited armor! So Can the spiffing brit break skyrim with an endless amount of armor that will super power our hero will smith into the stratosphere! so it's time for me to flex my exploit skills and break the game with infinite armor.

Amber Heard. After a 3 day break we opened with Johnny retaking the stand to finish his sparring match (err, cross examination) with Amber Heard's attorney Ben Rottenborn. Ben seemed to change tact this morning, opening with lots of audio, seemingly trying to establish that the arguments the couple got into and the resulting verbal exchanges from Johnny could qualify as domestic abuse. He then moved on to the 2018 OpEd, wanting to plant the seeds that anything prior to that publication by Ms. Heard was not at issue in this trial. Eventually Ben moved into the close of his testimony, coming fast and hard at Johnny with lines of questioning that seemed designed to provoke an outburst from Mr. Depp to demonstrate his alleged behaviours to the jury. It didn't work and Mr. Rottenborn drew lots of objections in these final few minutes, but he did his best to maintain his pace and attempt to close on a strong note.Following Rottenborn's close Johnny's team had the chance for redirect. They spent most of their time playing new pieces of audio from audio files already admitted into evidence. Basically, they played portions of audio from the same tapes Amber's team did, but different sections. The aim was to provide the jury a wider context to the clips played by the defense and shed new light on things Johnny may have said in those segments. The redirect closed on a very strong note with the Depp team playing the audio many had been waiting a very, very long time to hear. The clip where Amber tells Johnny (paraphrasing) 'Tell them you're a victim of domestic abuse, see how many people believe or side with you'. After this, Johnny's time on the stand came to an end. Moving swiftly along, next up was Ben King. Ben was Johnny's house manager and personal assistant. He is also the man who found Johnny's fingertip during the Australia Incident. His testimony provided insight into the aforementioned Australia incident, as well as a few other incidents in the couples history. The defense had a particularly bad cross examination of this witness, which was followed by an uneventful redirect by the Depp team. And that's it! That was the end of Day 8. Tell us what you thought in the comments below! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------For some background- This is a defamation case between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Johnny Depp is suing Amber Heard for defamation stemming from her OpEd published in The Washington Post in 2018. Amber Heard is counter suing for defamation claims based on statements made by Johnny Depp's former lawyer. The trial is taking place in Fairfax, Virginia, the proper venue as The Washington Post is headquartered in said location. Presiding is Judge Penny Azcarate, Johnny Depp is represented by Ben Chew, Camille Vasquez, and more. Amber Heard is represented by Elaine Bredehoft, Ben Rottenborn, and more.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Day 7 Recap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2uTzuT7Q8MSHOCKING Audio Played In Court: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40mhM5GBwuAJohnny Depp Gets SASSY On Cross Examination- 13 Moments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cczh_V6cnsETwo of the key incidents in play: What Do the Facts REALLY Say? | Johnny Depp v.

Welcome to a day in the life of a cancer patient at home ❤️‍🩹 Thank you to BetterHelp for sponsoring this video. Get 10% off your first month https://www.betterhelp.com/eamonandbecOn December 21, 2021 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. We embarked on a journey of healing beginning with 8 rounds of chemotherapy. Before chemo began I was terrified of losing my hair, of feeling weak and of becoming really sickly looking but I was determined to remain positive about how the treatment would affect me. Today we are sharing what a typical day looks like for us at home while living with cancer and the harsh effects of chemotherapy treatment. Our life at our cabin in the woods certainly looks different now than it did a year ago (think more napping, less building stuff 😜 ) but I hope anyone going through something similar may find a bit of hope in this episode. Maybe you feel a little less alone. Maybe you learn a new food trick. Or maybe you just take this as your reminder to go easy on yourself. Sending you all so much love and gratitude. Your messages, comments and prayers are felt by us both and we appreciate them all so much.0:00 Welcome to life with cancer!0:38 Best part of the day 🐶 1:50 One week post-chemo3:05 Update on chemo treatments4:24 EXCITING NEWS!!5:19 Morning movement 💪 🧘‍♀️ 8:34 How I really feel being bald9:20 What we're eating 10:04 Food changes with chemo10:50 Thank goodness for therapy 🙏 12:26 Oso's first One Wheel 14:20 Eamon's emotional update17:00 Easy chickpea quesadilla recipe17:40 I saw a naturopath19:58 Q+A from Instagram!24:20 Night time routine25:05 Missing Lee everyday26:51 Dinner 😋"

They are balanced to the teeth. This means rule-sets are set in place to create fair gameplay for everyone involved. Sometimes we do this dynamically. For example: Maybe a low ranked team would start with pistol only, then get a specter and light shield.
