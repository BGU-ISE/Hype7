The iconic highway—known for its retro diners, quirky motels, eclectic art installations and extraordinary landscapes—connects Chicago, Illinois to Santa Monica, California. On this day in 1926, the name “U.S. 66” was first proposed for the cross-country route.The video—set to the classic music track Route 66 by Bobby Troup—celebrates the cultural significance of one of America’s first national highways, and how it became a symbol of a changing nation. Learn more: http://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-route-66-------To follow Google Doodles on YouTube, subscribe to: @GoogleDoodles  Follow Google Doodles on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/GoogleDoodles"

Never have there been five friends as infamous as The Bad Guys—dashing pickpocket Mr. Wolf (Academy Award® winner Sam Rockwell, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), seen-it-all safecracker Mr. Snake (Marc Maron, GLOW), chill master-of-disguise Mr. Shark (Craig Robinson, Hot Tub Time Machine franchise), short-fused “muscle” Mr. Piranha (Anthony Ramos, In the Heights) and sharp-tongued expert hacker Ms. Tarantula (Awkwafina, Crazy Rich Asians), aka “Webs.” But when, after years of countless heists and being the world’s most-wanted villains, the gang is finally caught, Mr. Wolf brokers a deal (that he has no intention of keeping) to save them all from prison: The Bad Guys will go good. Under the tutelage of their mentor Professor Marmalade (Richard Ayoade, Paddington 2), an arrogant (but adorable!) guinea pig, The Bad Guys set out to fool the world that they’ve been transformed. Along the way, though, Mr. Wolf begins to suspect that doing good for real may give him what he’s always secretly longed for: acceptance. So when a new villain threatens the city, can Mr. Wolf persuade the rest of the gang to become … The Good Guys? The film co-stars Zazie Beetz (Joker), Lilly Singh (Bad Moms) and Emmy winner Alex Borstein (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel). Based on the blockbuster Scholastic book series by Aaron Blabey, The Bad Guys is directed by Pierre Perifel (animator, the Kung Fu Panda films), making his feature-directing debut. The film is produced by Damon Ross (development executive Trolls, The Boss Baby, co-producer Nacho Libre) and Rebecca Huntley (associate producer, The Boss Baby). The executive producers are Aaron Blabey, Etan Cohen and Patrick Hughes.

Head to https://keeps.com/icecreamsandwich to learn more and get 50% off your first order of Keeps. i went to new york, and had pizza in new york. the experience was really fun. i saw a lot of stuff and ate a lot of food but the highlight of the journey was the pizza from some random pizza joint. it was a really interesting experience because in the midwest everything is calm and spread out, in new york (and this was the first time ive been in new york) it's all dense and active! i really liked it i wish i could be there more tbh.i actually had a lot more to say in this video, but i cut it down because i ran out of time and needed to post today for CONTRACT REASONS which is not fun or preferable. I have been working on posting more but somehow always always always run up against some deadline. I am going to implement a new strategy where I am making a little bit of content every day instead of planning a ton and then making a lot of content all at once. idk what's the solution, but hopefully this workflow will be better for me. I just want to very casually make a video and be like hey i was in ny had pizza was a good time or hey i did this thing here's what happened funny jokes bla bla bla and not have it be once every one or two months. idk im just venting at this point. just know that i really appreciate you checking out the video even though my posts are super spotty, it's really helpful.thank you for watching as always ❤️MERCH IS HERE:https://icecreamsandwich.store/📱 twitter:https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy📷 instagram:https://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/"

They spent nearly a decade recording collisions in the Tevatron collider and another decade analysing the data. This culminated in the April 7 announcement that this obscure particle’s mass seems to be heavier than expected. So why do we care? Because understanding why this particle even has mass was one of the most important breakthroughs in our understanding of the subatomic world. And because measuring its precise mass either doubles down on our current understanding or reveals a path to an even deeper knowledge. The FermiLab discrepancy is a tantalizing hint of the latter.Need Catch Up On Your Fundamental Forces?https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsPUh22kYmNAnurqRx9JlDGukZCsYcLhFCheck out the Space Time Merch Storehttps://www.pbsspacetime.com/shopSign up for the mailing list to get episode notifications and hear special announcements!https://mailchi.mp/1a6eb8f2717d/spacetimeHosted by Matt O'DowdWritten by Fernando Franco Félix, Graeme Gossel, & Matt O'Dowd Post Production by Leonardo Scholzer, Yago Ballarini, Pedro Osinski, Adriano Leal & Stephanie FariaGFX Visualizations: Fernando Franco FélixDirected by Andrew KornhaberAssociate Producer: Bahar GholipourExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew KornhaberExecutives in Charge (PBS): Adam Dylewski, Maribel Lopez Director of Programming (PBS): Gabrielle Ewing Spacetime is produced by Kornhaber Brown for PBS Digital Studios.This program is produced by Kornhaber Brown, which is solely responsible for its content.© 2022 PBS.

Barkley called Nets' player Kevin Durant a 'bus rider', going on to say  If you ain't driving the bus, don't walk around talking about you a champion. Durant, or course, didn't take that lying down. With plenty of time on his hands now that the Nets' season is over, KD took to social media to post all of the times in his career Barkley had been a 'bus rider' himself.

Nick Wright tells Chris Broussard and Kevin Durant why the idea of Kyrie managing the team is ridiculous, and not what he wants to hear from the star after the Nets went 0-4.#FirstThingsFirst #NBA #KyrieIrvingDownload the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: https://foxs.pt/3z96p0jSUBSCRIBE to get the latest from First Things First: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRSTThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb►Watch the latest content from First Things First: https://foxs.pt/LatestOnFIRSTTHINGSFIRST▶The Herd with Colin Cowherd’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD►UNDISPUTED’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED ▶Speak for Yourself’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeSPEAKFORYOURSELF►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE►Club Shay Shay’s YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY▶Titus & Tate's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTITUSANDTATE►The Skip Bayless Show YouTube Channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow►What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube Channel: http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtubeSee more from First Things First: http://foxs.pt/FIRSTTHINGSFIRSTFoxSportsLike First Things First on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/FIRSTTHINGSFIRSTFacebookFollow First Things First on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/FIRSTTHINGSFIRSTTwitterFollow First Things First on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/FIRSTTHINGSFIRSTInstagramFollow Nick Wright on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/NickWrightTwitterFollow Chris Broussard on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Chris_BroussardFollow Kevin Wildes on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/KevinWildesTwitterFollow Jenna Wolfe on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/JennaWolfeTwitterAbout First Things First:Nick Wright, Chris Broussard, Kevin Wildes, and Jenna Wolfe team up on First Things First, a discussion and opinion-based studio program that covers all the headlines weekdays on FS1.Kyrie Irving 'promotes' himself to a management role for Nets next season | NBA | FIRST THINGS FIRSThttps://youtu.be/emHss8LWwOIFirst Things Firsthttps://www.youtube.com/c/FirstThingsFirst"

Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1sOriginally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 #travel #travelvlog #vanlife0:00 Moving Into Our New Tiny Home on Wheels2:00 We Found the Most Magical Natural Hot Spring in the Jungle4:31 We Almost Hit an Ant Eater4:59 Don't Do This If You're Afraid of Heights6:35 Arenal Volcano7:18 Thank You BetterHelp for Sponsoring This Video8:18 Costa Rican Food Tour11:05 Nate Fails to Impress the Locals11:44 An Update on Van Life12:33 Sleeping In Someone's Front Yard13:12 Full Tour of Our New Tiny Home On Wheels19:18 CROCODILE BRIDGE20:22 Thank You For 3 Million Subscribers!!!21:48 Beach Front Camping23:40 This Was Not How We Wanted Our Trip To End"

The remaining welterweight title not in Spence’s possession belongs to WBO titleholder Terence Crawford, who was an interested observer on Saturday, Tweeting his reaction to the Spence victory. Spence made clear his preference for his next opponent.   “Everybody knows who I want next,” Spence said. “I want Terence Crawford. That’s the fight that I want. That’s the fight everybody else wants. Like I said, I’m going to get these straps then go over there and take his too. Terence I’m coming for that belt!” Spence had to overcome some harsh conditions courtesy of Ugás to get to this point. After Ugás hurt Spence in the sixth, knocking his mouthpiece out with an uppercut, Spence of DeSoto, Texas, stormed back to hurt Ugás repeatedly to the body and eye. By the tenth round, Ugás’ right eye was completely shut when referee Laurence Cole stopped the contest for the second time to allow the ringside physician to inspect the damage. Unlike earlier, the doctor advised Cole to stop the bout at 1:44 of the tenth round, giving Spence (28-0, 22 KOs) a resounding victory, a third welterweight belt, and perhaps the greatest triumph of his still accumulating career following a 17-month layoff after corrective surgery to his left eye forced him to pull out of a mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao.   “I feel sad,” Ugás said. “I trained really hard for this fight. All my respect to Errol Spence. He’s a great champion. I’m just sad about what happened tonight. The referee stopped the fight, but I wanted to keep going to the end. I definitely had a chance to win the fight in the sixth round, but he recuperated well. Congratulations to him and his team.”#ErrolSpenceJr #YordenisUgas #SpenceUgasVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.SIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: https://pbcham.ps/FightAlertsFOLLOW US:https://twitter.com/premierboxinghttps://instagram.com/premierboxinghttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions"

Thats right all 123 unique armors of skyrim all equipped at the same time! What could possibly go wrong! Now there is no easy way to equip multiple armour or rings at the same time but luckily for us the wonderful Todd Howard in his infinite wisdom filled skyrim with endless overpowered skyrim exploits that allow us to glitch the game into equipping the entire catalogue of armour in skyrim onto our character! Now that sounds like skyrim is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits excluding unlimited armor! So Can the spiffing brit break skyrim with an endless amount of armor that will super power our hero will smith into the stratosphere! so it's time for me to flex my exploit skills and break the game with infinite armor. My power is unstoppable and I will defeat this impossible challenge with all of my skyrim experience to discover if this game is broken or if it is perfectly balanced game! What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced game series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold.

Get 10% off your first month https://www.betterhelp.com/eamonandbecOn December 21, 2021 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. We embarked on a journey of healing beginning with 8 rounds of chemotherapy. Before chemo began I was terrified of losing my hair, of feeling weak and of becoming really sickly looking but I was determined to remain positive about how the treatment would affect me. Today we are sharing what a typical day looks like for us at home while living with cancer and the harsh effects of chemotherapy treatment. Our life at our cabin in the woods certainly looks different now than it did a year ago (think more napping, less building stuff 😜 ) but I hope anyone going through something similar may find a bit of hope in this episode. Maybe you feel a little less alone. Maybe you learn a new food trick. Or maybe you just take this as your reminder to go easy on yourself. Sending you all so much love and gratitude.

Amber Heard. After a 3 day break we opened with Johnny retaking the stand to finish his sparring match (err, cross examination) with Amber Heard's attorney Ben Rottenborn. Ben seemed to change tact this morning, opening with lots of audio, seemingly trying to establish that the arguments the couple got into and the resulting verbal exchanges from Johnny could qualify as domestic abuse. He then moved on to the 2018 OpEd, wanting to plant the seeds that anything prior to that publication by Ms. Heard was not at issue in this trial. Eventually Ben moved into the close of his testimony, coming fast and hard at Johnny with lines of questioning that seemed designed to provoke an outburst from Mr. Depp to demonstrate his alleged behaviours to the jury. It didn't work and Mr. Rottenborn drew lots of objections in these final few minutes, but he did his best to maintain his pace and attempt to close on a strong note.Following Rottenborn's close Johnny's team had the chance for redirect. They spent most of their time playing new pieces of audio from audio files already admitted into evidence. Basically, they played portions of audio from the same tapes Amber's team did, but different sections. The aim was to provide the jury a wider context to the clips played by the defense and shed new light on things Johnny may have said in those segments. The redirect closed on a very strong note with the Depp team playing the audio many had been waiting a very, very long time to hear. The clip where Amber tells Johnny (paraphrasing) 'Tell them you're a victim of domestic abuse, see how many people believe or side with you'. After this, Johnny's time on the stand came to an end. Moving swiftly along, next up was Ben King. Ben was Johnny's house manager and personal assistant. He is also the man who found Johnny's fingertip during the Australia Incident. His testimony provided insight into the aforementioned Australia incident, as well as a few other incidents in the couples history. The defense had a particularly bad cross examination of this witness, which was followed by an uneventful redirect by the Depp team. And that's it! That was the end of Day 8. Tell us what you thought in the comments below! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------For some background- This is a defamation case between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Johnny Depp is suing Amber Heard for defamation stemming from her OpEd published in The Washington Post in 2018. Amber Heard is counter suing for defamation claims based on statements made by Johnny Depp's former lawyer. The trial is taking place in Fairfax, Virginia, the proper venue as The Washington Post is headquartered in said location. Presiding is Judge Penny Azcarate, Johnny Depp is represented by Ben Chew, Camille Vasquez, and more. Amber Heard is represented by Elaine Bredehoft, Ben Rottenborn, and more.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Day 7 Recap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2uTzuT7Q8MSHOCKING Audio Played In Court: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40mhM5GBwuAJohnny Depp Gets SASSY On Cross Examination- 13 Moments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cczh_V6cnsETwo of the key incidents in play: What Do the Facts REALLY Say? | Johnny Depp v.
